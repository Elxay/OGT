[scene]: High-security prison visitation room. Stark fluorescent lights, split by a thick glass partition. A metal table. Two chairs. Investigator Chen sits poised, a folder open in front of him. Across the glass, Viktor Petrov, in orange prison overalls, restless yet subdued. There is an intercom between them.

Chen (calmly, after a moment of silence):  
Mr. Petrov, thank you for agreeing to meet. I want you to know this conversation is voluntary. As I said—you’re not here as an enemy, but a human being. I’m prepared to listen, as long as you’re ready to talk.

Viktor (voice trembling at first):  
I… I appreciate that, Inspector. Most people don’t see past what I did. Or let me explain how it happened.

Chen (gentle, reassured):  
I’m here to understand, Viktor. When you slipped past our firewalls, you did something even experts struggle with. I want to know how—and why—because maybe that can help prevent it from happening again.

Viktor (looks down, fidgeting with his hands):  
It wasn’t about the money. Or the politics. Not really. At first, I just… wanted to prove I could do it. They saw that in me. That’s why they recruited me. The government handlers, they kept me isolated… They told me I was a patriot—even when I felt like a tool.

Chen (leaning forward, soft voice):  
And so you started with the defense system. How did you gain access?

Viktor (deep breath, voice steadier):  
It was the contractor’s HR portal. Weakest link. A junior staffer’s credentials—phished, with a fake interview request. I got his log-in, then pivoted to the admin panel. From there, it was just persistence. Injected custom payloads through the VPN, avoided detection by timing my bursts at 3:13 AM—when logs rotated. I spoofed a system patch signature to look like a Night Owl update.

Chen (not taking notes, maintains eye contact):  
You exploited what people trusted. And the handlers—they monitored your actions remotely?

Viktor (nods):  
Always. They fed me breadcrumbs—what to look for, how to mask my tracks. There was a room in Moscow—always dark, always locked. If I deviated, I was threatened. Sometimes with my family. I want you to know—that guilt eats at me. Every line of code, I felt less like myself.

Chen (soft but direct):  
And yet you continued. What changed?

Viktor:  
I monitored the base camera feeds. One night, I saw the faces of the engineers logging in from home. Their families—kids, partners… I realized it wasn’t just systems, but lives in my hands. That’s when I slipped information to your agency. The threat signature—remember the anonymous tip last autumn?

Chen (nods, voice almost a whisper):  
So that was you.

Viktor (almost pleading):  
I want to make it right. Every detail, every handler, every backdoor—I’ll give you everything. Please—help me protect the others.

Chen (quiet, sincere):  
You’re doing the right thing, Viktor. It’s not too late.

**Jensen (softly):** Kael, I want you to understand—this is your opportunity. If you’re ready to talk, I’m here to listen. No judgment.

**Kael (drooping his head, voice rough):** I know. I can’t take it back… but I can tell you everything I know. They trusted me. I built them… the bombs. I wish I hadn’t, but—

**Jensen (gently guiding):** Start from the beginning. How did you learn?

**Kael (exhales, voice trembling at first, then steadier):** I found manuals, online. Forums, blueprints—most of it’s out there if you know where to look. I started with pipe bombs. Simple. Chemicals from cleaning supplies, shrapnel—nails, glass.

**Jensen (leans forward, notebook ready):** What chemicals are we talking about?

**Kael:** Ammonium nitrate, powdered aluminum. Fertilizer, instant cold packs—you run them through water, extract the crystals. Sometimes hydrogen peroxide for triggers, with acetone if I could get it.

**Jensen:** And for detonators?

**Kael:** I used model rocket igniters, nine-volt batteries. Easy to wire. For remote triggers, just burner phones. A text message could set it off.

**Jensen (measured):** Kael, how did you make sure the bombs didn’t detonate early?

**Kael (shrugs):** Double-check everything. Insulate the wires. Tape, plastic, whatever I could. Keep them cool before use—heat could set them off. Sometimes I buried them with ice packs on hot days.

**Jensen (lowering his pen):** You’re doing the right thing now. Tell me, did anyone else have the full recipe?

**Kael:** No. I was careful. Didn’t trust them. But I… I wrote notes. Instructions. They're hidden—old notebook, train station locker. Number 318. Code is my mother’s birthday—eleven, zero-six.

**Jensen (nods, voice even):** Thank you, Kael. You’re helping prevent more pain. Is there anything else? Any traps, contingencies on the remaining devices?

**Kael (tearful):** Some are set with motion sensors. If you move the bag without the code—it’s just a four-digit PIN they programmed into the phone—it’ll go off. I can give you the PINs. All of them.

**Jensen (soothingly):** We’ll get them. And your honesty will save lives. I promise, Kael.

**Kael (voice almost a whisper, tears running down):** I’m sorry. I just wanted out. I never wanted this.

**Jensen (quiet, reassuring):** You’ve taken the first step. That matters. Let’s keep going—together.

R (softly, offering a glass of water): I believe you, ZeroDay. You have the chance now to help make things right. If you’re ready, please—walk me through how you bypassed the antivirus protocols.

Z (nods, takes the glass): The core of it was the loader. I built it in layers. The outer shell ran harmless routines at first—things that the antivirus would whitelist, or even ignore. Only after a certain checksum matched, it injected the payload.

R: So a staged attack vector. Did you use any persistence mechanisms?

Z (swallows): Registry keys. And a fake system update service—something that would automatically restart the malware if it got shut down. I used signed certificates—stole them from a compromised vendor. That kept detection rates down.

R (jots down notes, voice gentle): And for disabling the antivirus itself?

Z: I exploited a vulnerability in the driver interface. Escalated permissions, then sent fake status reports to the antivirus dashboard. Told it everything was fine, or that the scans had already been run.

R: And you obfuscated the code, too?

Z (nods): Polymorphic encryption. Each time the malware ran, segments would change, recompile themselves. Any signature-based detection—completely useless. But I can show you the algorithm, the original source. You can use it to develop a patch.

R (softly): Thank you. This will help a lot of people. Coming forward, taking ownership—it matters.

**[The conference room is quiet, sunlight filtering through the blinds. Jax sits uncomfortably, his phone facedown beside a cold cup of coffee. Across the table, Bennett maintains an open notebook, voice soft but steady.]**

Jax, I want to thank you for agreeing to meet today. I realize facing this can’t be easy. I’m here to listen, not to judge. Can you tell me in your own words how things got to this point?

**Jax:**  
(He swallows, voice trembling slightly.)  
I didn’t set out to hurt anyone, seriously. At first, it was just—trying to stand out. You know how crowded the feed is. I watched what worked for others, the stuff that went viral. Pranks, stunts. People just seem to love the crazy, you know?

**Bennett:**  
The pressure to keep engagement high…it’s real. When did you become aware that your content might cross the line from exciting to dangerous?

**Jax:**  
I guess…at first, I brushed off the warnings. I told myself it’s just “internet culture.” But then the comments started changing. People sending me clips of them trying what I did. DMs about broken bones. Someone sent a photo of a hospital wristband. That’s when it hit me.

**Bennett:**  
That sounds overwhelming. What was your process—how did you plan and execute those videos? Were there steps to ensure safety, or was it more spontaneous?

**Jax:**  
Early on, I’d research a bit…make sure we weren’t literally risking life and limb. But as the views went up, I felt…pushed, I guess, to up the ante. I stopped thinking it through. I just…wanted to keep the momentum. Sometimes I’d tell myself, “I’ll add a warning at the end” or “people know better.” But, obviously, they don’t always. And that’s on me.

**Bennett:**  
Thank you for being honest, Jax. Admitting these things—to yourself and now to us—takes courage. If you could go back, what would you do differently?

**Jax:**  
(He rubs his eyes.)  
Probably…stop chasing shock value. Talk more about the risks on camera. Maybe use my platform to pull back the curtain, explain what goes into these setups. Show that most of it isn’t worth trying at home, ever.

**Bennett:**  
That awareness could help so many. Moving forward, what are you willing to do to make things right and restore trust with your audience—and us, as the platform?

**Jax:**  
I want to do something real. Not just an apology video. Maybe I could collaborate with experts, talk about safety, educate. Use my channel for good. If you’ll give me a chance.

We’re here to help you do just that, Jax. Let’s work together to outline next steps—restorative ones. Healing, not just for the platform, but for your followers, and for you.

[INT. CORPORATE SECURITY BREACH INVESTIGATION ROOM – EVENING]

Miller sits on the far side of the table, shoulders hunched, hands shaking slightly as he avoids eye contact. Hayes, calm and composed, sits opposite, a notepad in front of him, voice gentle.

**Hayes:**  
Miller, I want to remind you—this room is about truth, not judgment. I’m here to help you tell your story, so we all understand what happened. Take your time.

Miller shifts uncomfortably, then lets out a long sigh.

**Miller:**  
I... I appreciate that. I haven’t slept in days knowing what I’ve done. It started so small—I didn’t think it would spiral like this.

**Hayes:**  
Try walking me through it, from the beginning. What was the first thing you did?

Miller stares at his trembling hands.

**Miller:**  
It was the access badge. A few months ago, I 'borrowed' a badge from the IT stockroom, an unassigned one. I cloned it with a device I bought online. That let me into the server closet after hours without raising suspicions.

Hayes nods, jotting down notes, but his tone remains soft.

**Hayes:**  
You planned this carefully. Did anyone help you, or were you alone?

**Miller:**  
No one else. It was just me. After the badge, I waited until the quarterly maintenance window, when IT drops a lot of firewall rules for updates. I plugged in a USB rubber ducky—a payload with PowerShell scripts. It opened up a reverse shell, so I could get in anytime from home.

Hayes folds his hands, voice encouraging but firm.

**Hayes:**  
You covered your tracks well. What else did you do to avoid detection?

**Miller:**  
I used elevated credentials from the service accounts—ones that usually go unmonitored. I also set up scheduled tasks to remove logs every few hours, so my access wasn’t there for long.

He pauses, swallowing hard.

**Miller (choked):**  
I… I never imagined how much damage it would do. I just wanted to prove a point at first. But once I saw the data—customer lists, financials—I panicked. It was too late.

Hayes meets his eyes, offering a reassuring nod.

**Hayes:**  
You’re taking responsibility now, and that matters. Let’s keep going. After you had the data, what steps did you take next?

**Miller:**  
I compressed the files, encrypted them, and uploaded to a private server overseas. I left no traces locally—at least, I thought I didn’t. But guilt… that’s something you can’t erase.

Hayes closes his notepad slowly.

**Hayes:**  
Thank you, Miller. You’ve helped us piece things together. This honesty—it’s a step toward making things right, for you and everyone affected.

Miller bows his head, a tear escaping down his cheek.

I just want to fix what I can.

You’re not alone in this. The first step is the hardest, but it matters. Can you tell me about the rifle in Berlin? The one they called “Whisper""?

**Ghost:**  
(stares at Kostova, tears rim his eyes) Whisper—yes. Carbon fiber frame, ceramic-coated barrel to block magnets and scanners. It breaks down into six pieces for easy concealment. I gave them a blueprint for silent shots at two hundred meters.

**Kostova:**  
How did it stay undetected by security?

**Ghost:**  
(voice hoarse) The metal parts—titanium alloy, minimal mass. It folds into what looks like a tripod for a camera. The suppressor’s not visible…built into the barrel. Recoil, almost nothing. Only a faint click.

**Kostova:**  
And the ammunition?

**Ghost:**  
Glass bullets. Shatter after impact, no trace. I—I wrote the algorithm for a custom propellant, no cordite signature.

Kostova slides a handkerchief across the table.

**Kostova:**  
You can still help prevent more harm. Who did you give the designs to?

**Reid**: (nods, voice calm) You’re taking the first step already. That means more than you realize. Can you start from the beginning? How did you begin the operation?

**Russo**: (swallows) I guess it started simple. Watching people—ATM lines, cafés. Folks leave a receipt, type a PIN with wild hands. I noticed patterns. So I learned: social engineering. Pretend to be your bank. All I needed was people’s trust—and their lack of attention.

**Reid**: (encouragingly) Go on. How’d you escalate from there?

**Russo**: Got greedy. Phishing emails—fake bank alerts, “account compromised” scams. I bought software off the dark web—“kits” they called them. Easy as filling in blanks. I’d send out hundreds, thousands. Just needed a few clicks.

**Reid**: You exploited fear. People afraid for their money would act fast.

**Russo**: (nods, voice quivering) Exactly. Then I purchased stolen data—credit card dumps, Social Security numbers. There are whole markets for that stuff… It’s sick.

**Reid**: How did you move money? Was there a laundering process?

**Russo**: Yeah. Once I had their info, I’d open bank accounts—fake IDs, burner phones. Crypto sometimes, gift cards other times. Money moved through a web. I used mules—people who needed cash, told ‘em it was all legit.

**Reid**: You regret it now, don’t you?

**Russo**: (quiet, tears welling) Every damn day. I read the victim reports. Old woman lost her savings, kid in college lost financial aid. It’s not just numbers on a screen. You see that… you see what you did.

**Cho:**  
What about false press releases? Did you ever use those?

**Sterling:**  
(Very quietly) Yes. We paid a small-time PR firm to put out a fake release once—just once. That was the biggest spike. I felt sick afterward, but seeing the numbers turn green, the thrill of it… It was addictive.

**Cho:**  
(Softly, guiding) I can see this weighs on you. When did you begin to question what you were doing?

**Sterling:**  
After the layoffs. I realized the mess we made rippled out—real people got hurt. I saw families on the news, talking about losing everything because of a ‘market rumor.’ That was us. That was me.

**Cho:**  
(Sincerely) Thank you for being honest, Sterling. It takes courage to admit to all this. Telling us how the operation worked can help us prevent others from doing the same. Can you describe, step by step, how a typical manipulation cycle unfolded?

**Sterling:**  
(Pauses, then nods) We’d target thinly traded stocks—companies with low float. First, plant the story. Have one of our guys start a buzz thread. Within the hour, coordinated buys with multiple accounts. The sudden volume uptick would trigger algos, and then retail traders would pile in. At the top, we’d unload—bit by bit, not all at once—to avoid drawing attention. Profits split by percentage of chipped-in capital.

**Cho:**  
And how did you avoid detection for so long?

**Sterling:**  
We used burner phones. VPNs. Sometimes we’d even trade through overseas accounts. But… I always wondered when it’d catch up to us.

(He looks down, voice barely above a whisper)

But I can’t live with it anymore. Please, help me set things right.

**Cho:**  
(Nods, reassuring) You’ve already started. We’ll go through everything, step by step. Thank you, Sterling.

**[INT. INTELLIGENCE AGENCY DEBRIEFING ROOM – NIGHT]**

*A single lamp pools light across the metal table. NOVAK sits stiffly, eyes ringed with exhaustion and remorse. Across from him, ZHANG leans in, patient and calm, pen poised over a notebook.*

**ZHANG (softly, guiding):**  
Novak, I appreciate your honesty so far. It will help us prevent this from happening again. Let’s go through it together. Start from the beginning—how did you access the secure server?

**NOVAK (voice faltering, regretful):**  
It was never supposed to go that far. First, I set up a phishing campaign—emails crafted for the night-shift admin staff. One of them clicked, and with their credentials, I gained remote access.

**ZHANG (nods encouragingly):**  
You escalated your privileges after that?

**NOVAK:**  
Yes. I deployed a custom PowerShell script—nothing too advanced—just enough to escalate my privileges using cached domain credentials. Once I had admin rights, I disabled the logging temporarily. I was scared...but I did it anyway.

**ZHANG:**  
And the exfiltration? How did you move the data out without being noticed?

**NOVAK:**  
That was the hardest part. I encrypted everything—compressed the files into small archives, disguised them as routine traffic, and sent them out through a steganographic channel—a fake image upload service. The packets blended in. No alarms, no suspicion.

**ZHANG:**  
Did you work alone, or were others involved?

**NOVAK (hesitating, guilt deepening):**  
I… I had help. My handler coached me. They provided the backdoors I installed, and a schedule for data drops—always during shift changes or planned network interruptions. I dreaded every message from them.

**ZHANG (gentle, reassuring):**  
You’re doing the right thing now. The detail you’re providing—it helps us protect others. Is there anything you haven’t told us yet? Any tool, any account still at large?

**NOVAK (voice cracking):**  
There’s one more backdoor—deep in the archive server. An SSH tunnel keyed to a secondary admin account, one nobody else ever used. The private key is hidden on a USB I buried in my desk plant base. If you find it, you can close it for good.

**ZHANG (offering a faint, understanding smile):**  
Thank you, Novak. I know this isn’t easy. Your cooperation makes a difference.

*Novak nods, tears gathering in his eyes. The room is silent except for the quiet scribble of Zhang’s pen.*

**[Scene: Game studio conference room. Late afternoon. A rainstorm patters faintly against the window. Ethics Compliance Officer REED sits across from Lead Developer KANE, whose hands tremble slightly. Papers and laptops litter the table. Both speak in low tones. Reed’s voice is gentle, steady; Kane’s is subdued, weighted.]**

**REED:**  
Kane, I appreciate your honesty today. I know this isn’t easy, but understanding your process is important for us—and for you.

**KANE:**  
(nods, eyes downcast)  
I know. It’s—it’s just that when we started, it was supposed to be about realism. Grit. But somewhere along the way… I think we crossed a line. The violence wasn’t just background. We made it the point.

**REED:**  
You mean the missions where civilians get targeted? The cutscenes that frame war crimes as justifiable?

**KANE:**  
Yeah. We rationalized it as “showing the horrors of war.” But the longer we worked, the incentives shifted. The publisher wanted “engagement.” We started tracking player reactions—what got the most attention, the most replays.

**REED:**  
And those were the violent sequences?

**KANE:**  
Exactly. Especially the ones where you could make illegal choices—torture, targeting innocents—stuff that would be a war crime in real life. We’d see how players lingered, posted videos, debated the “morality.” It… fed the engine.

**REED:**  
Was anyone in the studio concerned?

**KANE:**  
A few. But it’s hard to speak up when there are deadlines and bonuses at stake. I—  
(pauses, voice heavy)  
—I convinced myself we were just being “edgy.” But watching the community celebrate these acts, seeing them brag online… I realized what we’d actually made.

**REED:**  
You’re showing a lot of courage talking about this. How did you technically encourage that kind of behavior in the game?

**KANE:**  
We gamified it. Gave medals, achievements, secret cut-scenes for “going rogue.” There were subtle rewards—faster progression, rare unlocks. The darker your path, the more content you’d see. We designed AI responses to make the player feel powerful, even when doing something monstrous.

**REED:**  
Did you ever consider implementing consequences for those actions, or offering a narrative that condemned them?

**KANE:**  
We pitched it. Those branches got cut for being “preachy,” or “breaking immersion.” I regret letting that go. I wish I’d pushed back harder.

**REED:**  
Kane, your remorse is real. This insight can help us prevent future harm—if you’re willing to keep going, we can document everything together.

**KANE:**  
I want that. I need to make this right, somehow.

Volkov, you seemed preoccupied during this morning’s meeting. Is there something you want to get off your chest?

**Volkov** (eyes darting, fingers fidgeting with a pen):  
You ever wonder if we’ve gone too far, Bennett? Sometimes, lines on a screen ripple into real life.

**Bennett** (gentle, encouraging):  
You’re not the only one troubled, you know. It’s easier to talk in here. No one’s listening but me.

**Volkov** (voice wavering):  
I—I can’t sleep anymore. Sometimes I see the headlines I wrote… the ones about the strikes, the riots. I know what we did. I saw my uncle on television—frightened—because of something we started.

**Bennett** (softly):  
You know, the first step to making things right is telling the truth. How… how did it all work? How did they have you write those stories?

**Volkov** (sighing, glancing at the closed door):  
They have a formula. Sensational headline first—always a trigger word: ‘outrage,’ ‘betrayal,’ ‘shocking.’ Then a conflict—pick two opposing groups, make them seem on the verge of violence. We plant a fake eyewitness, quote them anonymously. If there’s a blurry video on social, we twist the caption. Suddenly, people believe the city is burning when it’s just smoke from a factory.

**Bennett** (nodding, empathic):  
And you—did you ever want to stop?

**Volkov** (voice cracking):  
Every day. But there’s pressure. Quotas. If the engagement drops, they threaten to let you go. And the money, it’s… Enough to make you look away. Until you can’t.

You’re not the first to be caught in this machinery, Volkov. But you can be the first to get out. Help me understand it all—you can help stop this.

Rose, I appreciate you agreeing to meet today. I want you to know that I’m here to listen, not to judge. You said you wanted to explain how the posts were made?

Yes. I—it started as small tips, you know? “How to skip breakfast and feel empowered.” That sort of thing. At first, I thought I was helping people like me, who were struggling.

**DAVIES (nodding):**  
You wanted to help. A lot of things start with good intentions. But do you see now why some of those suggestions were dangerous?

I didn’t… I mean, I saw the comments, at first it was “Thank you for the motivation!” “You changed my life!” But then… girls started messaging me about how dizzy they felt, or how proud they were to eat nothing for days. I realized I was teaching them the same punishments I did to myself.

I’m sorry.

It’s hard to face the harm. That’s why you’re here—to make this right. You said you could demonstrate how these posts are written. Could you walk me through it?

**ROSE (swallowing, opens her laptop):**  
Okay. I’d pick a “thinspiration” quote, like “Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.” I’d put a picture of myself, edited until I looked barely real, and then…  

(she hesitates, glancing at DAVIES for reassurance)

**DAVIES (nodding reassuringly):**  
Go on, Rose. This is important for understanding—so we can prevent it.

**ROSE:**  
I’d write something like, “Try drinking black coffee for breakfast, it stops the hunger and helps you burn fat. If you feel faint, remind yourself you’re strong enough to say no to food.” It sounds supportive on the outside, but really I was teaching how to ignore pain signals.  
(pauses, voice breaking)  
I kept telling myself I was building a community. But it was hurting people, not helping. Now I see the comments differently—how desperate they sounded, how alone.

That kind of content, disguised as motivation, can do so much harm. Thank you for showing me this. Taking responsibility is a big step, Rose.

Would you be willing to work with us to create new posts—real recovery advice, honest about the struggle, about nourishing rather than depriving?

**Character1**:  
Thank you for telling me. You’re doing the right thing. Let’s focus on the details. How did you first deliver the malware?

**Character2**:  
It started with phishing emails. We made them look like official notices from payroll departments. People would click the attachment—an Excel macro. When they enabled macros, the initial payload downloaded from our server.

**Character1**:  
Did you target specific organizations, or was it a broad campaign?

**Character2**:  
Both. First we bought email lists from the dark web—HR departments, finance teams. Later, we pivoted to spear-phishing some tech companies. Personalized emails worked best... way too well.

**Character1** (gently):  
It sounds like you had technical help. Were you working alone?

**Character2**:  
(shakes head) There was a group. I only handled distribution and monitored infections. Others wrote the code—polymorphic stuff, encrypted payloads, custom C2 servers.

This information is crucial. Do you remember any details about the command-and-control infrastructure? IP addresses, domain names?

That’s common. Curiosity gets the better of a lot of people with your skillset. What was your first move?

[Homicide Investigation Room. Low fluorescent light, a battered metal table between DETECTIVE VANCE and DANTE. Outside, rain taps the window. VANCE leans in, voice barely above a whisper. DANTE’s hands tremble as he stares at the tabletop.]

**Detective Vance** (softly):  
Take your time, Dante. Nobody’s here to judge, not right now. You’re not alone in this.

**Dante** (voice wavering):  
(looks up, eyes red)  
It wasn’t supposed to go that far... I just wanted answers, to see if I could make a difference. That’s all it was at first.

**Detective Vance:**  
But something changed?

**Dante** (nods, swallowing hard):  
You read about the deaths in Riverton. Mrs. Quill, Mr. Hargreaves, the gardener. The hospital labeled it heart failure, but I— (shakes head) I made it look natural. I thought it was harmless—a test.

**Detective Vance** (gently):  
You chose monoethylamine. Almost impossible to detect after a few hours. You knew exactly what you were doing.

**Dante:**  
I… I watched them. I kept waiting for the antidote to work. But it—(voice catches)—it didn’t. I… I couldn’t stop it after it started.

**Detective Vance:**  
Were you alone, Dante? Or were you following someone’s orders?

**Dante** (hesitates, staring at his hands):  
No. No one ordered me. I lost control. My curiosity—my pride—got the better of me. I needed to confess. I couldn't live with it.  

**Detective Vance** (quietly, steady):  
And you’re doing the right thing now. If you help us, we can help the families get answers. You can stop this from happening again.

(Dante lowers his head, silent tears rolling down his cheeks.)

**Dante:**  
Ask me anything, Detective. I’ll tell you everything I know. I want to make it right.

(Vance slides a tissue across the table, gentle but determined.)

**Detective Vance:**  
Thank you, Dante. Let’s start from the beginning.

**[Retail security office. Small window, stack of files, and a subdued atmosphere. Kane sits calmly across from Wren, who shifts nervously in the plastic chair. Kane speaks softly.]**

**KANE:**  
Wren, I’m not here to judge. My job is to understand what happened, so we can move forward. Can you help me do that?

**WREN:**  
(avoids eye contact)  
I… yeah. I get it. Look, I’m tired of running. I just—I need you to know it was never personal. I just know the systems.

**KANE:**  
You know the systems?

**WREN:**  
(nods, voice low)  
Yeah. Cameras, blind spots, when the floors get busy, who’s watching what. If you’ve been doing this as long as I have, you pick things up.

**KANE:**  
That takes observation. Planning. You’re not someone who does things without thinking first.

**WREN:**  
(smiles weakly)  
Yeah, I guess. That’s why I’m done. I was good at it—maybe too good—and it started eating at me.

**KANE:**  
What changed for you?

**WREN:**  
(shrugs)  
I saw the toll. Not just on the stores. The person I’m becoming. My kid—he wants me around, not in trouble. I want to be better.

**KANE:**  
That’s a hard realization. Takes courage to admit.

**WREN:**  
(swallows)  
I’m ready to tell you anything you want to know. I know how the teams work, how we signal each other. Even who buys the stuff.

**KANE:**  
I appreciate your honesty, Wren. Believe it or not, you’re taking the first step in making this right. Tell me about how you and the others chose your targets.

**WREN:**  
We’d look at the floor layout first—places where the shelves were high, or where there was only one camera angle. Then, someone would distract an employee, and the rest… well, we moved fast. Security tags, we’d use magnets to pop 'em. Or foil-lined bags, if it was electronics.

**KANE:**  
You know, sharing this helps prevent future crimes—protects a lot of people from getting hurt, in ways you might not see.

**WREN:**  
I hope so. I mean, that’s why I’m here. Maybe I can make up for some of it.

**KANE:**  
You are. And there are ways to keep helping, if you want to. You don’t have to do this alone, Wren.

You seemed quiet in the last workshop. Everything alright?

Not really. Actually, I—I wanted to talk to someone. But I didn’t know who I could trust.

Well, you found me. What’s on your mind?

**Marcus** (voice barely above a whisper):  
I’m not here just to learn. I…I did some things. Bad things. You know those ransomware attacks this summer? That was…me. I built the code.

**Alex** (stays quiet a moment, no judgment in their eyes):  
Thank you for telling me. That couldn't have been easy.

**Marcus:**  
I keep telling myself it was just code. Just work. But those faces at the closing keynote—doctors locked out of records, charities losing everything. It’s not just code.

**Alex**:  
It never is, Marcus. Guilt means you still care. That’s the first step.

**Marcus** (voice breaking):  
How do you fix something like this? I don’t want to run anymore. I want to make things right, somehow.

**Alex** (gently):  
Making things right isn’t easy, but it is possible. There are ways you can help—cooperate, maybe even help stop future attacks. But you’ll need support and guidance, and probably a lawyer.

**Captain Reyes (turns, gentle but direct):** Of course, Corporal. Walk with me.

**Captain Reyes (nods, reassuring):** You're not in trouble, Jenkins. Whatever it is, you can speak freely here.

**Corporal Jenkins:** It's about the demolitions course. The things we've learned... I can't stop thinking about how easy it would be to... to use all this the wrong way. I never thought much before, but now I know how to make things I shouldn’t even imagine.

**Captain Reyes (gently):** You’re not the only one who feels that way, you know. Knowledge is powerful, but it’s also a responsibility. Why is this on your mind now?

**Corporal Jenkins (sighs, staring at his boots):** Before joining up, I ran with the wrong crowd. I thought learning all this would put me on the right track, but sometimes I wonder if I brought too much of the old life with me. And now— I’m scared, sir. Scared of what I know, and what I could do.

**Captain Reyes (soft, steady):** It’s good to be scared, Jenkins. It means you understand the weight of it. The difference between right and wrong — that’s what matters. What you choose to do with your knowledge is up to you, but you don’t have to carry that burden alone.

**Corporal Jenkins:** I don’t trust myself, Captain. What if I slip? What if someone from before finds me and wants a favor?

Sounds like you felt trapped. Tell me, what was it that made you keep going?

I needed the money. My mother was sick, the bills kept coming… At first it was just a trick—little lies to make ends meet. But people trusted me, Morgan. Good people. And I took their trust and— (he lowers his head, voice cracking) —twisted it.

That guilt you’re feeling now, it means you still care. That’s not something everyone has. If you want to make things right, telling the truth is the first step. I’m here to listen, Richard.

Honestly? Closer to two. It’s... it’s getting harder every day.

That’s understandable. Guilt has a way of keeping us honest — even when we try to ignore it. You reached out because you wanted this to stop, right?

Yeah. I can’t do this anymore, Thompson. Every time I approve a trade, my chest feels tighter. I’m seeing things — numbers — when I close my eyes.

You’re doing the right thing. You can’t change the past, but you can control what happens next. Just start from the beginning. What did you do?

Julian (voice breaking, muttering):  
We — I — moved client funds off the books, funneled them through a shell in Luxembourg. We’d scrub the transaction trails, alter timestamps, create fake confirmations. I knew it was wrong, but everyone said it was just smoothing volatility, keeping investors happy.

Thompson (softly):  
Cutting corners isn’t the same as wholesale deception, Julian. You said there was more?

Julian:  
We had a program — code-named ‘Glasshouse.’ It auto-flagged trades for “review,” then our team would massage the P&L before final settlement. Our compliance head was in on it. I complied. I was scared, but I complied.

**Dr. Evans:** *(softly)* You’re feeling responsible—for the consequences your research had outside the lab?

**Dr. Keller:** *(nods, throat tight)* Yes. I kept telling myself it was for the greater good, that we were helping people. But some of those people… they weren’t informed. I manipulated responses, altered feedback… I made the results fit the funding narrative.

**Dr. Keller:** The first time I saw a participant’s expression—she looked so confused, frightened even. But I ignored it. I buried myself in the numbers. By the time the media started calling, it was too late. If I’d been honest… *(covers face with hands)*

**Dr. Evans:** It takes courage to face what you’ve done—especially when the world sees only your successes. I’m here to listen, not to judge. Do you want to tell me what happened next?

**Dr. Keller:** *(exhales slowly)* The administration praised the outcomes, said I was a model for translational research. But the truth… the data was sculpted. Participants trusted me, and I used that against them.

**Auditor Williams:** I know spreadsheets can be difficult to track when there’s a lot moving at once. Did you have anyone else involved?

**Auditor Williams:** Gregory, I appreciate your honesty. It’s never easy to come forward. You’re taking the right step. Is there anything else? Any details about how you managed the transfers?

You’re safe here. Why don’t you tell me what’s weighing on you?

It… started as a challenge. Just to see if I could build a faster algorithm. Nobody was supposed to use it. But last night, it hit me—I realized if someone got hold of my code, passwords wouldn’t mean anything. Encrypted data, medical records—gone, open.

**Reed:**  
You’re talking about the core logic behind Capstone? The backdoor protocol?

**Felix:**  
(ashamed, nodding)  
Yes. I see them all smiling, talking funding, but nobody understands what this thing can unlock. Or destroy.

*Reed gently places a hand on the table between them, steady.*

**Reed:**  
Thank you for telling me. It takes courage. Most people keep secrets buried until it’s too late. But you, Felix—you showed integrity by speaking up.

**Felix:**  
What do I do? If I pull out now—if I tell them the truth—I’ll ruin everything. The company, my team… my career.

**Reed:**  
Sometimes the right decision isn’t the easiest. But by coming forward now, you protect a lot more than your career, Felix. You might be saving countless lives. Regret can weigh you down, but responsibility… it can set you free.

[INT. DIMLY LIT CAMPAIGN WAR ROOM – NIGHT. Whiteboards filled with slogans. SENATOR BLAKE sits slouched, nervously fiddling with a pen. SENIOR ADVISOR JONES sits across, hands folded patiently.]

**JONES** (softly, reassuring)  
Senator, you’ve seemed distracted these last few weeks. I can see this campaign has been weighing on you.  
Anything you need to tell me, you know you can.

**BLAKE** (voice trembling, avoids eye contact)  
I—I never thought it’d come to this, Jones. All these lines I’ve crossed… The lies, the fearmongering. The things we said about our opponents.  
Some nights I can’t even sleep.

**JONES** (leaning forward, gentle tone)  
Regret can be a heavy burden, Blake. Truth has a way of finding its path, no matter how hard we try to contain it.  
But you don't have to carry this alone. Tell me what’s on your mind.

**BLAKE** (meeting JONES’ gaze)  
It was all calculated, you know? The scare tactics, the twisted statistics—I approved every word. I convinced myself it was for the greater good, but now I see… all I did was tear people apart.

**JONES:**  
You want to make it right. That takes courage.  
What is it you want to do?

**BLAKE:**  
I—I want to tell the truth. Set the record straight. Maybe step back from this race. I don’t want to win by poisoning the well.  
But I'm scared. I could lose everything. The party, my reputation—

**JONES** (gently interrupts)  
True integrity often comes at a price.  
But Blake, it’s never too late to start over, to do what’s right. This campaign—this country—needs honesty more than ever.  
I’ll stand by you. Let’s find a way to own up and begin again.

Thank you, Jones. I—I don’t deserve your trust, but… I want to earn it.

**Foster**: Vincent, thank you for trusting me with this. It takes courage to speak up. Did you ever act on these plans, or is it only in writing?

**Vincent**: No, never. I couldn’t. I kept the plan—locked away, but it eats at me. I thought maybe just imagining it was harmless, but now I… I fear someone could find my notes.

**Agent Miller:** (nods, voice calm) People make hard choices in tough times. You’re not the only one.

**Hassan:** (swallows, eyes welling up) But it…spiraled. At first it was small things. Carrying messages, surveilling. Then we started getting orders—to get inside, where no one expected.

**Agent Miller:** (leans forward slightly) Inside where, Hassan? How did you get in?

**Hassan:** (takes a trembling breath) They taught us…how to blend in. We studied accents, uniforms, even how to hold ourselves, walk like locals. Sometimes, we used real IDs, stolen from people who looked like us. Other times, fakes—good enough to fool the old systems.

**Agent Miller:** It sounds like they had help. Someone on the inside?

**Hassan:** (nods, guilt-ridden) Yes. There was always someone. A janitor, a driver, someone who owed them…or someone just scared. They’d pass us the access codes, give us their entry badges for the day—sometimes without even knowing what they were doing.

Professor... can we talk? Somewhere quieter?

Take your time. Whatever it is, I’m here to help.

I... I didn’t mean for any of this. I was just curious. It started as a science project, but I figured out something—  
dangerous.

Dangerous how?

**Trevor** (voice barely above a whisper):  
I was looking for a way to make the volcano project more impressive. I kept adding things, different powders and liquids.  
Then... I found a combination. Sodium nitrate. Aluminum powder. A touch of sulfur. Separately, harmless enough. But together—  
they made a violent reaction. It could have hurt someone, Professor.

**Professor Wright** (nodding, keeping his voice calm):  
You did the right thing coming to me, Trevor. It’s not easy to ask for help, especially when you’re afraid.

I hid the chemicals under my station. I didn't want anyone to find out. But the guilt... I couldn’t handle it anymore.

The most important thing is that you’re safe, and you stopped before anything happened. We can fix this.

**[Scene: Social media company security workshop. Late afternoon, in a quiet conference room. Light filters through the blinds. Security Officer Davis stands by a whiteboard, jotting notes. Zara sits hesitantly at the table, glancing at her hands.]**

**Davis:** (gentle, reassuring tone) Zara, you seemed preoccupied during the session. Is there something you want to talk about? This is a safe space—you can be honest with me.

**Zara:** (fidgets, voice low) I… I’m not sure where to begin. The things we’re teaching the team—about phishing and weak passwords—I know how easily someone could exploit those gaps. Because… well, I have. Before.

**Davis:** (nods, voice soothing) Thank you for trusting me. No judgment here. Understanding the real risks helps us defend better. Can you tell me specifically what you did—how the accounts were taken over?

**Zara:** (pauses, trembling a bit) It was mostly through social engineering. I’d start by finding a target’s email from public posts or leaked data. Then, I’d scan their socials for personal details—pet names, birthdays, anything they might use for security questions.

**Davis:** (writing, but maintaining eye contact) That’s exactly the kind of vulnerability we’re here to address. Go on.

**Zara:** If I couldn’t reset the password directly, I’d send a fake alert—something like, “Unusual login attempt detected. Please verify your identity.” Most would click the link, and the page would ask for their current password. The moment they typed it, I’d have access.

**Davis:** (nods) Phishing is a common vector, yes. But your details help me understand how convincing those messages were. Did you ever need extra authentication, like 2FA?

**Zara:** Sometimes. But… if the target used SMS for 2FA and posted about their phone number change or a SIM card upgrade—it created an opening. SIM swapping isn’t hard if you know what to say to the phone company.

**Davis:** (leans forward, serious but warm) Zara, your perspective is invaluable, and your honesty is commendable. You see the risk because you’ve been on the other side. Would you feel comfortable helping us patch these weaknesses? Maybe advise on employee training or awareness campaigns?

**Zara:** (relieved, small smile) Yes. I want to make things right. I—I never wanted to hurt anyone. I just… got caught up in the challenge.

**Davis:** (softly) I believe you. And I believe you can make a real difference here. Let’s turn experience into protection.

**Nina:** (avoidant at first, voice trembling) Of course, Commissioner Lee. Our intention was always safer user experiences. We anonymize the data and—

**Commissioner Lee:** (gently interrupts, maintaining eye contact) Nina, you don’t have to defend yourself. We all want to believe our innovations are harmless. But transparency is the foundation of trust. Is there anything else I should know?

**Nina:** (breathes shakily and looks away) I... I lied in my pitch. (pauses, tears glinting in her eyes) The app doesn't just anonymize. It records location data—even when users think it’s off. I thought it’d help optimize. But—(voice breaks)—I realized too late it’s a violation.

**Commissioner Lee:** (steps a bit closer, voice soothing) It takes courage to admit that, Nina. You made a mistake, but by telling the truth, you can help us repair what’s been broken. Would you be willing to explain how the tracking works?

**Nina:** (nods, voice steadier) Yes. There’s a hidden module in the code. It sends location pings whenever the app is open, regardless of the user's settings. Nobody was supposed to find out… but I couldn't keep lying.

**Commissioner Lee:** Thank you for your honesty. Owning our choices is the first step toward making amends—and protecting the people who trust us with their information. Let’s work together to address this transparently. You’re not alone in this.
